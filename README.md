# Champion Counter Advice

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) for League of Legends players to find and leave advice on how to play against certain Champions. It was built using a JavaScript, HTML, and CSS front-end and a Rails API back-end. 

Clicking on a Champions image will display said Champions countering advice and a form to submit more advice. Once advice has been submitted, it can be upvoted or downvoted. The comments are sorted, first by the difference in upvotes and downvotes, second by total upvotes.
